# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to clean student data, received in csv format, to assess math hand reading scores by student and across different districts.

## Results

* The district summary is affected to a lesser degree than the school summary, given the larger volume of students in the district. 
* The school summary is affected with a subset of the scores not being counted; essentially the average now only accounts for 10th through 12th graders.
* Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affects Thomas High School's negatively relative to other schools.

## Summary
After the scores were removed from ninth-grade math and reading at Thomas high school, the averages changed for the school. The sample size decreased for math and reading scores, the school's scores decreased as a result of this as well.
